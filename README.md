An application that makes it possible to optimize the cutting of boards in an automated way,
in order to lose the least wood

The aim of the project is to develop a woodboard cutting management application.
 The company receives a set of customer orders and has to cut the different boards
 requested (rectangular in shape at the beginning) from large wooden panels purchased
 from a supplier. 

The principle is therefore to optimize in an automated way the cutting of the boards
 so that the company loses the least wood (because the deforestation of the Amazon is
 not very 2021).
